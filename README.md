### The Three Broomsticks – Console Billing System  
A beginner C++ restaurant billing project inspired by the wizarding world

#### About the Project

This was my **very first proper programming lab assignment** (CSC284 – Programming in C++, Summer 2023) when I was a 1st-year student in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at IUBAT.

As a huge Harry Potter fan, I chose **The Three Broomsticks** — the famous pub in Hogsmeade — as the theme for my imaginary restaurant.  
The task was to build a console program that takes customer orders from a menu, calculates the total with 5% VAT, prints a clean payment slip, and returns change in Bangladeshi Taka (notes + cents).

#### Features

- Hogwarts-style welcoming interface with centered text
- Display of 6 menu items with prices in BDT
- Personalized greeting using customer name
- Order multiple items by serial number + quantity (servings)
- Automatic calculation: subtotal + 5% VAT
- Delivery address collection
- Change returned in Bangladeshi currency notes (1000 → 1 TK) + cents
- Basic input validation

#### Technologies Used

- Language: C++
- Standard libraries: `<iostream>`, `<string>`, `<iomanip>`, `<cmath>`
- Concepts practiced: 1D arrays, loops, functions, user input handling, output formatting (`setw`, `setprecision`, `left`/`right`), basic error checking

#### How to Run

```bash

# Compile
g++ main.cpp -o threebroomsticks

# Run (Windows)
threebroomsticks.exe

```
It was originally createdon Summer 2023. Years later, it still reminds me why I love building things — especially when they have a bit of magic in them.
Hope you enjoy your visit to The Three Broomsticks… even if it's just through the terminal! 🧙‍♀️🍺
Made with butterbeer, late-night debugging, and a lifelong love for Hogwarts.
